# WordPress Admin Account Function

## Introduction

The WordPress Admin Account function is a convenient piece of code designed to simplify the process of creating an administrator account on WordPress.

## How It Works

This function works by checking if a username and email already exist in the WordPress database. If they do not, it creates a new user with the specified username, password, and email address, and assigns the new user the 'administrator' role. 

## How to Use

To use this function in your WordPress project, simply add the function to your theme's `functions.php` file or in a custom plugin file.
